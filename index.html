                <p class="main-text">
                    <br>New Yorkers have a lot to be stressed about: crowded subways, exorbitant rent prices, long work hours and endless competition are just a few of the troubles that plaque residents of the five boroughs. The Big Apple also been ranked
                    one of the <a href="http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/americas-favorite-cities-2015">dirtiest
                    and rudiest cities</a> in America. Ironically, stress itself is also extremely stressful, so much so that the <a href="http://scitechconnect.elsevier.com/stress-health-epidemic-21st-century/">World Health Organization</a> declared
                    stress "the health epidemic of the 21st century."
                    </br>
                    <br> According to a study by the <a href="http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2012/new-york.aspx">American Psychological Association,</a> New Yorkers are slightly more stressed than the rest of the nation. Sixty six percent
                    are stressed about their health, compared to only 51 percent in other parts of the country. But a whopping 78 percent of New Yorkers said money was their No. 1 concern, compared to only 69 percent of Americans in the rest of the country.
                    But is that really a surprise, in a city where <a href="https://www.rentjungle.com/average-rent-in-new-york-rent-trends/">averaged rent prices reached $3,076 in January?</a> Other major stressors include anxiety over the economy, family
                    issues, lack of space and not enough hours in the day. One thing is clear: New Yorkers are stressed out and it's taking a toll.
                    </br>

                    <br>“If your body is constantly stressed then it won’t be able to handle it and will eventually fail,” said Justin Horwath, a physical therapist at Manhattan’s Spear Physical Therapy. "You heart will suffer and in the long run so will
                    your quality of life.”
                    </br>


                    <br>While stress is part of the human condition, failing to manage stress properly can
                    <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress-symptoms/art-20050987">wreak havoc on the body.
                </a> Studies have shown that <a href="http://www.healthline.com/health/stress/effects-on-body">extended periods of stress</a> have been linked to hypertension, heart disease, migraines, fertility problems, constipation,
                    backaches, lowered immune function, rheumatoid arthritis and more. Stress has also been linked to obesity and diabetes. When a person is stressed they are less likely to make suitable food choices. Even worse, chronic stress can lead
                    to mental illnesses, like depression, and in some cases death.
                    </br>
                    <br>The culprit is <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-athletes-way/201301/cortisol-why-the-stress-hormone-is-public-enemy-no-1">cortisol,</a> that stress hormone released into the bloodstream when the pressure is on.
                    While a little bit of anything is okay, too much cortisol causes the body to go into fight-or-flight mode, or acute stress response, characterized by increased heart rate, muscle tension, constricting blood vessels and heavy breathing.
                    In short, the body is preparing for a brawl. Horwath pointed out that good stress, such as exercise, actually benefits the body, helping to complete physically challenging activities or get out of a bind. But over the long-haul too
                    much stress cause the body to suffer permanent ailments.
                    </br>

                    <br> Janice Kiecolt-Glaser, director of the Institute for Behavioral Medicine Research at Ohio State University's College of Medicine, said managing stress becomes even more important as you age. “Age magnifies the effects of stress
                    on the immune response,” she said.
                    </br>
                    <br> This is of little comfort for stressed out and overworked New Yorkers.
                    </br>
                    <br> The APA survey revealed that 53 percent of New Yorkers listen to music to destress, while another 51 percent relieve stress with exercise.
                    </br>

                    <br> Vicky Ge Huang of Brookyn often works 10-hour days at her job on Wall Street. This leaves her little time for friends or exercise.
                    </br>
                    <br>“I am sitting at my desk all day," she said. "I feel so unhealthy.” To let off steam Ge Huang said she enjoys Zumba classes - when she can find the time, which is rare.
                    </br>
                    <br> But Horwath said finding time to unwind and have fun is key to managing stress. “You can take meds to decrease your blood pressure and other problems,” he said. “Or you can find something to make you relax.”
